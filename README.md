# discord-link-opener
Automatically open browser tabs when links matching given constraints are sent in discord channels.

# Disclaimer
Use at own risk!

Automating normal user accounts (generally called "self-bots") is against the [Discord Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines) and may result in an account termination (ban) without prior notice.

# Installation and Usage
1. Download Python 3.6.x or 3.7.x or 3.8.x . Before installing, make sure to check “Add Python to PATH”.
2. Once installed, open CMD and type:
```
pip install discord.py[voice] 
pip install asyncio
pip install pyyaml
```
3. Download Link Opener: https://github.com/Smidelis/discord-link-opener/
4. Extract the contents of the *.zip file to a local folder of your choice (desktop/documents/...)
5. Copy config_example.yaml and rename it to config.yml.
6. Open the config.yml and replace the placeholders with the values for the token (tutorial on how to find your token: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tI1lzqzLQCs), the keywords you're looking for, the blacklisted words and the channels.
7. Three browsers have been implemented: chrome, edgechromium and firefox. Change the user_choice to the value of your preferred browser.
8. Save the file.
9. Open PowerShell/CMD and change directory (cd) to the folder, where you have extracted the *.zip file to.
10. Run open.py.
11. Wait for the bot to automatically open new browser tabs when links matching given constraints are sent in the specified discord channels. 
12. Cook.
